# DeskText
A sane, cross-platform bginfo implementation

![example picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daed/DeskText/examples/osx.png)

The bgInfo utility is a handy tool for administrators to be able to display useful support information in a place that is easy for users to access.  The problem is that implementations of this tool are either Windows only (bgInfo by sysinternals) or unmaintanable and broken (BGINFO4X).

The aim of this utility is to provide similar functionality to those tools, while being maintainable.
